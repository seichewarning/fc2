FC2-MICRO:
This is the name for the EC2 mirco instance running the file
copying script.
When creating an image for this machine, it's best to create a 
medium or large one, other wise it runs out of memory installing
everything.


MODEL-M5:
This is the name for the large instance running the models.

    as a different user simply replace 'ubuntu' with that
    user everywhere below.

     touch ~/.ssh/config
     chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
     echo 'IdentityFile ~/.ssh/fc2' > ~/.ssh/config
     cat ~/.ssh/fc2.pub

  - copy the output from the public key above.

  - ssh into the MODEL-M5 instance as user ubuntu and run
     cat > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

  - the above command expects input, paste the public key
    into here.  Hit Enter, Hit ctrl+D when done to close and save the file.

  - ssh back into the FC2-MICRO instance.

  - verify you can ssh into the MODEL-M5 instance from the FC2-MICRO
    instance by running this.  Use the prive IP address, hit yes if asked
      ssh ubuntu@MODEL-M5.private-ip-address

  - edit the crontab logged in as 'ubuntu' via the command
      crontab -e

  - add the following line
      * * * * * /usr/bin/ruby /home/ubuntu/code/fc2/fc2.rb
