FC2-MICRO:
This is the name for the EC2 mirco instance running the file
copying script.  FC2 stands for Forecast Command and Control.
When creating an image for this machine, it's best to create a 
medium or large one, other wise it runs out of memory installing
everything.


MODEL-M5:
This is the name for the large instance running the models.


Instructions for setting up the FC2-MICRO instance:
  - ssh into the instance as user 'ubuntu'.  If its' set up
    as a different user simply replace 'ubuntu' with that
    user everywhere below.

  - run these commands
     sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
     sudo apt-get -y install ruby
     sudo apt-get install -y awscli
     sudo gem install aws-sdk-ec2 --verbose
     sudo gem install aws-sdk-s3 --verbose

  - configure AWS credentials, run 'aws configure' then get give
    it the information it asks for.

  - run these commands

     git clone https://github.com/seichewarning/fc2.git ~/code/fc2
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f ~/.ssh/fc2
     chmod 600 ~/.ssh/fc2
     touch ~/.ssh/config
     chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
     echo 'IdentityFile ~/.ssh/fc2' > ~/.ssh/config
     cat ~/.ssh/fc2.pub

  - copy the output from the public key above.

  - ssh into the MODEL-M5 instance as user ubuntu and run
     cat > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

  - the above command expects input, paste the public key
    into here.  Hit ctrl+D when done to close and save the file.

  - ssh back into the FC2-MICRO instance.

  - verify you can ssh into the MODEL-M5 instance from the FC2-MICRO
    instance by running this.  Use the prive IP address
      ssh ubuntu@MODEL-M5.private-ip-address
